The dataset provides a wealth of information, with the number of casualties standing as a pivotal metric for understanding the severity and impact of these accidents.

**Data Cleaning and Processing:**

Before embarking on the analysis, I meticulously cleaned and processed the dataset to ensure its accuracy and consistency. This involved addressing missing values, correcting errors, and formatting the data appropriately for analysis.
I've crafted a dynamic dashboard that serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding various aspects of road accident casualties.

**Dashboard Highlights:**

Casualty Breakdown: Visualizes fatal, serious, and slight casualties to understand accident severity.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Examines total casualties by vehicle type for targeted intervention strategies.

Monthly Trends: Compares current and previous year casualties to identify temporal patterns.

Road Characteristics: Explores casualty variations based on road type, surface, location, and light conditions.
